    "body": "<p>One of the most amazing feats in recent sports history occurred on April 13th, 2016 when Kobe Bryant played in his final NBA game against the Utah Jazz. Many regard Kobe as arguably one of the greatest players in NBA history. A 17-time All-Star, 11-time All-NBA selections, five world championships and an MVP award coming his way in the year 2008. The accolades could go on and on but you get the point. <img src=\"/img/kobe1.jpg\" class=\"pull-right\"> Throughout the entire season the Lakers were horrible and Kobe was the worst shooter in the entire league by percentage. Some say his subpar play was due to the amount of years he has played basketball and the wear and tear on his body. Others look to his old age and believe that the amount of injuries he\/'s sustained in the past few years are to blame. Whatever the case may be the box office attraction that was once Kobe Bryant did not diminish, in fact, it increased exponentially. Stadiums around the country were sold out any time the Lakers came to town so that fans could get one last look at The Mamba. For most of his career, Kobe had been hated anywhere besides Los Angeles (naturally). But the hate directed towards this man seemed to come out of jealousy, anger, frustration and most importantly, respect. Fans all over the country despised Kobe when he came to play against their teams because he was just that good. They hoped and hoped that their own star players would someday become good enough to be able to challenge his greatness and be able to beat him. Rarely has that worked, especially in playoff contests. They hated, but respected him because the amount of time and energy he put in to strengthen his game and become the best player he could possibly be is unparalelled.</p><p> Throughout this past season however, Kobe got way more cheers than jeers. Since he announced his retirement early in the season fans began clamoring for tickets. The feel in most of the away stadiums seemed confusing for a while. Fans didn\/'t seem to know what they wanted to see most: their team win, or Kobe go off for 30 or 40 points? On some nights they got to see a Kobe show but their team would beat the Lakers, which was ideal. But Kobe spent most of the first half of the season shooting bricks. His legs were not under him, and his body was not used to the high level of play that an NBA game requires after missing almost two full seasons. He started coming into his own midway through the season with a group of young players around him leading the show. But when Kobe had a chance, he still showed flashes of his old self that people had become accustomed to throughout the years.</p><p>Fast forward to last Wednesday night, and Kobe put on a masterpiece performance. He scored 60 Points for the sixth time in his career. Yes you read that right, SIXTY POINTS. Many sports analysts guessed Kobe would go out and score about 30 to 40 points due to the amount of shots he would take. But they never saw this coming. It was a performance for the ages. He had 22 points by halftime and scored 23 points in the 4th quarter alone to lead a 10 point Laker comeback in the final two minutes of the game. Kobe looked like Kobe. Hitting fadeaway jumpshots, three pointers, and a go-ahead jumper in the last minute of the game to put the Lakers ahead for good. After the ensuing Jazz miss, Kobe was sent to the foul line for the last time in his career sitting on 58 points. He made his first and second free-throws to give him the big 6-0. He then exited the game and addressed the crowd afterwards in an amazing post-game speech with the final words being 'Mamba Out'. He was already legendary before this game, but now he has erased the memory of him struggling for most of this past season and elevating himself into another stratosphere which most of us fans didn\/'t even think was possible.</p>"

    "body": "<p>After dominating the sport of boxing over the course of a decade, Manny Pacquiao has announced his retirement. <img src=\"/img/pacquiao.jpg\" class=\"pull-right\">The announcment came by way of post-fight interview after defeating Timothy Bradley in 12 rounds. These two fighters were no strangers towards one another as this was the third meeting between the athletes in their fight trilogy. The first fight ended in favor of Bradley by controversial split-decision in which many boxing analysts and fans criticized the judges who participated in the event for giving Bradley the victory. It seemed pretty clear to most people who were watching that Manny won the fight. He outworked Tim every step of the way. Manny simply outboxed him. But then when the decision came, Bradley was awarded the victory to the shock of many different individuals. The second match went exactly like the first with Manny Pacquiao\/'s skills on full display.</p><p><div class='container'><p class='container'>He was punishing Bradley at every turn and this time the judges scored accordingly. Manny came to leave no doubt that he had won the fight. It was as impressive of a performance as we had seen in his career and served as redemption for the first fight that these two had. Which takes us to the most recent bout on April 9th,2016. It was a fight for the ages with each round becoming more impressive than the last. Both fighters were landing more often than not in quick bursts of action. Pacquiao was throwing a series of quick combinations and landed a short hook that put Bradley down on the canvas. The knockdown proved to be nothing more than a slip in the eyes of many. Then again in the 9th round Manny lands a huge shot on Bradley knocking him down for the second time in the fight to. There was no doubt about this lethal blow as Bradley did a backwards somersault and almost careened into the stands. After that Bradley was not the same and Manny was able to close out the fight in convincing fashion earning him his 58th career professional boxing victory.</p></div><p> Afterwards in the ring Max Kellerman asked Manny if the rumors were true and if he was in fact retiring to which Manny replied 'Yes'. He informed us of the bigger issues he wished to face outside of Like the state of his home country The Philippines which is filled with corruption, crime, poverty as we well as many other societal discrepancies. He is after all, a politician back home and uses his wealth and public status to assist the nation in which he came from. We know another big name fighter by the name of Floyd 'Money' Mayweather, who Manny fought and lost to last year, also announced his retirement back in September, so the question on everyones mind is whether or not Manny is retired for just the time being, or if he is saving himself for a mega-rematch, between him and Floyd? Nonetheless if this really is it, It has been a pleasure watching one of the greatest fighters to ever live perform in the boxing ring for the better part of a decade.</p>"

    "body": "<p>Before Super Bowl 50 began, many had already written off the Denver Broncos as a favorite to come out victorious. <img src=\"/img/peyton.jpg\" class=\"pull-left\">They were after all, going up against the 15-1 Carolina Panthers. Who had destroyed most of the opposition standing in their way throughout the regular season and playoffs. Led by Cam Newton, the Panthers finished the season number 1 overall and earned two home playoff games, including a rematch against their rival the Seattle Seahawks. The score was 31 to nothing Carolina before you could by the end of the first half. The Panthers ended up winnign that game 31-24. Their second game against the Cardinals, was even more of a blowout with the score ending up to be 49-15 It almost seemed inevitable that they were going to finish the season as champions. Then on the other side you have the number one ranked defense Denver Broncos with a quarterback in Peyton Manning who was in his 18th regular season at 39 years of age. Hobbled with plantar fasciitis for most of the season, Peyton had to sit out for 7 games and came back just in time for the playoffs. He had a great game in the divisional round against the Pittsburgh Steelers completing 21 out of 37 passes and throwing for 222 yards. The Broncos won that game earning themselves a second round matchup with their rival the New England Patriots. Peyton again put on a show throwing two touchdowns to his tight end Owen Daniels in the first half. It also helped that the defense was swarming Tom Brady every chance they had and even intercepted a 2 point conversion attempt by Brady to tie the game, ultimately sending the Broncos to the big game. After the game Peyton Manning met with Bill Belicheck in the middle of the field and told him, 'Hey, listen, this might be my last rodeo. So, it sure has been a pleasure'.</p><p>The Broncos had earned their second trip to the super bowl in the past three years going up against the juggernaut Carolina Panthers and Peyton Manning was ready to finish his career. Instead of being the star he has been accustomed to being his entrire career, the Broncos\/' gameplan was to defend and let Peyton manage the game the best way that he could. Given his age and injuries, Denver could not rely on Peyton putting on a show. Instead they played the smart way and neutralized the Panthers attack strategy with their defense, limiting Cameron Newton to only 18 completions and no touchdown passes, as well as two fumbles. It was almost a shutout. No one was expecting a game like this. For the formidable Panthers to all of a sudden flop in the biggest game of their careers and allowing Peyton Manning to end his career on a high note. The last scoring play of the game was a touchdown by the Broncos with a succesfull two-point conversion pass from Manning himself. The score ended up being 24-10 Broncos and Peyton Manning was at the forefront of success for the final time in his career. The game encapsulated his entire career. He played the smart way, the right way, and exited the game with class. His hard work ethic and and sportsmanship is a strong example of what all athletes should aim to be, as well as all people. With his official retirement statement coming two weeks after the SUper Bowl, Peyton again showed us just how classy of a man he is. With statements like 'When I look back on my NFL career, I’ll know without a doubt that I gave everything I had to help my teams walk away with a win.' and 'Well, I’ve fought a good fight. I’ve finished my football race and after 18 years, it’s time. God bless all of you and God bless football'. The man played the game the right way and his name will now live on etched in the minds of football fans and sports fans alike leaving us with not much to say except, thank you Sheriff."
